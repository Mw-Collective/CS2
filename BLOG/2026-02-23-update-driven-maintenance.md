# Update-Driven Maintenance Checklist

## Source-Backed Facts

- Valve Developer provides a CS2 command list page generated from game binaries.
- The same page notes that command availability can change and may include hidden/development commands.
- Counter-Strike has an official updates feed for release tracking.

## Inference for This Repo

- Inference: After major updates, command-level validation should be part of normal maintenance.
- Inference: Commands in each preset should be re-checked against current documentation before expanding profile complexity.

## Suggested Checklist

1. Review the official update feed.
2. Re-check used commands against Valve Developer docs.
3. Keep only commands that are documented and still relevant.
4. Record the review date in documentation.
